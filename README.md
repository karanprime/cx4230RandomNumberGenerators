# cx4230RandomNumberGenerators
Random Number Generators from CX4230 Project 2

The python .py files are used as helper functions. The ipynbs contain demos and it will be easier to inspect code in ipynbs. RandGen30.ipnyb will show you the cellular automaton behind your random number. RandomNumberAnalysis.ipynb contains an analysis of random number generators.
